# Learning Journal Day 4 - June 22, 2019

## Day 4 and the longest day of the course is here, hooray! Excited to get into some HTML, CSS, and javaScript!

### HTML & CSS - Process & Design

#### How to approach building a site
- Understand who your target audience is
  - Ask questions about the people you would expect to visit your site
  - Think realistically. Even if your site is based on a product used worlwide, it is not likely someone from another country will come to your site for this product.
- Target audience
  - Age range
  - Gender
  - Location
  - Average income, level of education, family status, occupation
  - Access channel


#### Understanding your audience and their needs

Create some fictional visitors from your typical target audience. They will influence design decisions. Once you know who your characters are, consider **why** they are coming to your site. Create a list of reasons why people would be coming to your site.

- Are they looking for general entertainment or do they have a specific goal?
  - Specific goals could include just looking for general info or researching a topic or looking for a particular fact
  - Are they familiar with the prduct or do they need to be introduced?
  - Is the information time sensitive such as breaking news?
  - Are they looking for buying information?
  - Do they need your contact information?
- If there is a specific goal, is it personal or professional?
- Do they see spending time on this activity as essential or a luxury?

Visitors needs -
- Do visitors need you to introduce yourself, brand, or subject area?
- Will visitors be familiar or will they need background on the information you are covering
- What is special about what you offer or differentiates you?
- Are there any common questions in your subject area?
- How often do you need to update your site?


#### How to present information visitors want to see

Once you know what needs to appear on your site, you can start to organize the information into sections or pages.
It is important to reflect the public's understanding of the subject rather than just the site owner's understanding of it.

    - Future plans
  - Visit
    - Location
    - Hours
    - Tickets
  - Shop
    - Books
    - Gifts    
  - Contact

**Wireframes**
A wireframe is a simple sketch of the key information that needs to go on each page of a site. It shows the hierarchy of the information and how much space it might require.
Wireframes should include elements such as logo, primary navigations, headings and main bodies of text, user logins, etc.
Wireframes should not include color scheme, font choices, backgrounds, or images for the site.

**Design Navigation**
Navigation not only helps people find where they want to go, but also helps them understand what your site is about.

Good navigation is:
- Concise
  - Quick and easy to read. Limit the number of options in a menu to no more than eight links
- Clear
  - Users should be able to predict the kind of information they will find on the page before clicking on it
- Selective
  - The primary navigation should only reflect the sections or content of the site. Functions should be elsewhere
- Context
  - Good navigation provides context. It lets the user know where they are in the website at that moment. Use a different color or some kind of visual marker to indicate the current page
- Interactive
  - Each link should be big enough to click and change appearnce when users hover over it
- Consistent
  - Keep primary navigation exactly the same          

  ## Design with CSS
  ### What is CSS? How to control the design to make your webpages more attractive. CSS associates style rules with HTML elements

  Rules contain two parts: a selector and a declaration.
  **Selectors** indicate which element the rule applies to. The same rule can apply to more than one element if you separate the element names with commas.

  **Declarations** indicate how the elements referred to in the selector should be styled. 
  Declarations sit inside curly brackets and each is made up of two parts - property and value, separated by a colon.
  **Properties** indicate the aspects of the element you want to change. For example, color, font, width, height and border.
  **Values** specify the setting you want to use for the chosen properties. For example, if you want to specify a color property then the value is the color you want the text in these elements to be.

  Link CSS files in your HTML files to apply the styling.

  Get your skeleton in place first. Capture each tag first. Then go through each tag and define what it will look like
