Q:How does JavaScript make web pages more interactive? 
A: JavaScript can access content, modify content, program rules, and react to events. JavaScript allows you to make web pages more interactive by accessing and modifying the content and markup used in a web page while it is being viewed in the browser.

Q: How does JavaScript react to events?
A: You can specify that a script should run when a specific event has occurred. For example, it could be run when:
- A button is pressed
- A link is clicked on
- A cursor hovers over an element
- Information is added to a form
- An interval of time has passed
- A web page has finished loading

JavaScript can validate forms! How cool is that? I'm connecting a lot of dots during this reading. A lot of (or more like all) the common functionality I see in web browsers is because of JavaScript. For example: slideshows, refreshing only part of a page, value calculations and displaying the result, even filters.

Now let's get to the ABCs-
A. All about scripts
- a script is a series of instructions that a computer can follow to achieve a goal. You should compare scripts to recipes, handbooks, or even manuals. Scripts can run different sections of the code in response to the situation around them.

To write a script, first state your goal and then list the tasks that need to be completed in order to achieve it. Create a flowchart.

####Expressions: An expression results in a single value. Broadly speaking there are two types of expressions
1. Expressions that just assign a value to a variable
2. Expressions that use two or more values to return a single value


Functions have 3 parts:
1. Inputs aka parameters - sandwich ingredients (turkey, pepperjack, wheat bread)
2. work - making the sandwich
3. output - a sandwich

Functions give us "abstractions" - the ability to get stuff done without worrying about how it's happening

We can write our logic one, and use it over and over with different inputs to get customized results

Function Syntax: We need a place to hold inputs, a name, a place to define the work, and a place to say what the output should be
