## Now, let's get to the good stuff-

**_"What is a growth mindset?"_** you ask? Well my friend, let me tell you!
A growth mindset is a personal belief that you can do anything you set your mind to! You are not limited based on your current state of talent, skills, or intellect. Your only limitation is the amount of effort you exert.

**_"What are some examples of what I can achieve with a growth mindset?"_** Wow! look at you being all curious. Here's a list of a few really cool things you can achieve with a growth mindset:
1. Learn a new language
2. Learn how to sing, act, create art
3. Become a mathmetician (even if you thought you really hated math!)
4. Become a pilot, astronaut, or even a pro skateboarder!

**_"That all sounds really cool. Where do I even begin?"_** Here are some tips for motivating yourself to keep a growth mindset top-of-mind
- Embrace a challenge
- Gives yourself the positive recognition you deserve!
- Be curious & keep an open mind
-Be patient. Don't worry if you don't understand something right away. At some point, everyone found themselves in a position where they didn't understand!
