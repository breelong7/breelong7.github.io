# Logical Operators, Loops, and Other Fun Things

Logical operators allow you to compare the results of more than one comparison operator. 

&& = Logical and
This operator tests more than one condition. If both expressions evaluate to **true** then the expressions returns **true**. If just one of these returns **false**, then the expression will return false.

|| = Logical or
This operators tests at least one condition. If either expression evaluates to **true** then the expression returns **true**


! = Logical not
This operator takes a single Boolean value and inverts it
!(2 < 1) returns **true**
This reverses the state of an expressions. If it was false without the ! before it) it would return true. If the statement was true, it would return false.

Logical expressions are evaluated left to right. If the first condition can provide enough information to get the answer, then there is no need to evaluate the second condition


if statements - The if statement evaluates (or checks) a condition. If the condition evaluates **true**, any statements in the subsequent code block are executed.

If..else statement checks a condition. If it resolves to **true** the first code block is executed. If the condition resolves to **false** the second code block is run instead.
